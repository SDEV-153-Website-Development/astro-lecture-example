# 🍖 Juicy Garlic-Herb Pork Tenderloin

A simple, flavorful pork tenderloin that stays juicy and works great for weeknights *or* dinner guests.

## ⏱️ Time

- Prep: 10 minutes
- Cook: 20–25 minutes
- Rest: 5 minutes

## 🛒 Ingredients

- 1 pork tenderloin (1–1.25 lb)
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp salt
- ½ tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp dried rosemary (or thyme)
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- ½ tsp onion powder
- Optional: 1 tbsp butter (for extra richness)

## 🔥 Instructions

1. **Preheat oven** to **425°F (220°C)**.

2. **Season the pork**  
   Pat the tenderloin dry. Rub all over with olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, rosemary, paprika, and onion powder.

3. **Sear**  
   Heat a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high. Sear pork for **2–3 minutes per side** until nicely browned.

4. **Roast**  
   Transfer skillet to the oven. Roast for **12–15 minutes**, or until internal temperature reaches **145°F (63°C)**.

5. **Rest**  
   Remove from oven, add butter on top if using, and tent loosely with foil. Rest for **5 minutes**.

6. **Slice & serve**  
   Slice against the grain and serve warm.

## 🍽️ Serving Ideas

- Mashed potatoes or roasted baby potatoes  
- Green beans, asparagus, or a simple salad  
- Drizzle pan juices over the sliced pork

## 💡 Tips

- Pork tenderloin ≠ pork loin — tenderloin is smaller and cooks faster.
- Use a meat thermometer for best results.
- Leftovers make great sandwiches or tacos.

Enjoy! 😄
